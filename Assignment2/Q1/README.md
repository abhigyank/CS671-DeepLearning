# Readme for Q1


Programming Language -

Python 2.7

Modules - 

keras 2.2.4
Tensorflow 1.3.11
matplotlib 2.2.3
numpy 1.16.12
sklearn 0.20.1

Install the above dependencies using pip for python 2.7.

Ensure the dataset folders - `LineData` from the previous assignment are present in the directory. `MNIST` data is downloaded from Keras servers. If internet access is not there, copy the `mnist.npz` from `MNIST` into `~/.keras/datasets` folder. 

### Part 1

`cd` into `part1` folder.

For MNIST  - 
`python par1-mnist.py`

For Line Data run - 
`python data1-line.py`

The models are save in `model` folder.


### Part 2

`cd` into `part2` folder.

For Line Data run - 

`python linex.py`

where x is from 1 to 3 and are the 3 variations of the model tried in the same order as described in `report.pdf`.


For MNIST  - 
`python mnistx.py`

where x is from 1 to 6 and are the 6 variations of the model tried in the same order as described in `report.pdf`.


The models are save in `models` folder.
